###This is an example application for the darpi framework

It shows the basic framework features like creating handlers, middleware, background jobs and such.
With a few lines of code, we have a fast, safe and testable api.

This example includes integration with external frameworks like [diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel) and 
[graphql](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql).
